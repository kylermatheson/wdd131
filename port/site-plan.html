        How to Start a Successful Business?
      </h3>
      <p>
        
Early on, entrepreneurs should know what they want to sell. Entrepreneurs ought to sell what they love, but profitability must remain a key factor. To know if a product can be profitable, business owners would benefit from doing market research to understand if their product will be viable in the open market.
The U.S. Small Business Administration (2023) has made a list of what they believe to be six important questions to answer in market research. They state the following: 
“Demand: Is there a desire for your product or service? Market size: How many people would be interested in your offering? Economic indicators: What is the income range and employment rate? Location: Where do your customers live, and where can your business reach? Market saturation: How many similar options are already available to consumers? Pricing: What do potential customers pay for these alternatives?” (para. 4).
The questions show a clear path of needed information to understand if a product can be viable on the open market.  To obtain such an answer, research can be primary or secondary. Primary research is direct research from consumers. This is done through surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Secondary research is business statistics and consumer statistics. Overall, this research is necessary for the success of the business because it avoids pitfalls such as making a product that consumers aren’t interested in or providing a service that is saturated in your area. 
After having a good understanding that the product or service can be viable, it comes time to write the Business Plan. A business plan is a well-written document designed to be the blueprint of how the company will run to sell products or services. It is used to show investors and loan managers that the business is worth investing in and can stay afloat. A business plan is organized into multiple parts. The first part is an executive summary, which showcases the goals and methods that make the business successful, and the plan also includes details such as location, financial growth projections, and a mission statement. Secondly, the plan contains a company description. A company description describes the product or service in detail, the customer, and the unique value proposition of your product or service. Thirdly, in your business plan, you should lay out a market analysis that displays why you're different than the competitor, the pricing of the service or good, and procedures of how the company will deal with challenges. Next, develop a formal mission statement that describes your values, beliefs, and goals as a company. The mission statement should be used internally as a guiding statement for employees in the overall vision of the company. The organizational structure of the company should be laid out in the business plan, such as describing the different roles of the company's employees and, legally, how the company was organized. An operations plan should be described in your business plan, detailing the bills of materials and the standard operating procedure at the company. A marketing plan should be outlined with the four Ps of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion. To fill these four Ps in the marketing plan, the business plan may include a customer profile, the price of product location, a social media plan, an advertising plan, and a swot analysis. Lastly, the business plan should include a financial plan, which contains a breakeven analysis of financial goals and a five-year projection. Overall, a business plan is there for the company and investors to see the basic outline of the business’s present and future plans to deliver a successful product or service.
Other important steps to making your business idea come to fruition are taking necessary legal steps such as registering the business, getting federal and state tax IDs, applying for licenses and permits, opening a business bank account and business insurance, and choosing the legal business structure. This may seem like a lot, but it is mostly nuance and checking boxes. It’s hard to go into detail because of the complexity of each state-by-state law, and it’s best to be looked at by a case-by-case company. However, choosing a business structure is essential and can affect many future decisions. This one can also vary a lot on the type of business you are running, but in most cases, a startup, especially, can default to a limited liability company or L.L.C. An L.L.C. has the best overall option compared to the other business structures because it allows you to protect your personal assets and avoid double taxation. To sum up, the legal actions you must take to start your business are very important but must be dealt with on a case-by-case process. 
To summarize, when starting a business, it’s essential for business owners to understand that their product can be viable and it’s something that they love to do. Then, business owners must understand the plan and the steps they must take to make their product or service come to life: doing market research, creating a detailed business plan for investors and a roadmap for themselves, and taking the legal necessary to bring the business to life. In the end, these steps are almost all clerical steps that hopefully save a headache, but what determines the success of an entrepreneur’s business is their grit and determination.

      <h3>
        Why do New Businesses Fail and Succeed?
      </h3>
      <p>
        
When it comes to starting a business, there is a lot that goes into it; a lot can go wrong.  The article Why Start-ups by Tom Eisenmann (2021) “Most start-ups don’t succeed: More than two-thirds of them never deliver a positive return to investors” (para. 1). Statistics make starting a business seem to be daunting, but fear stems from not knowing.  The following information in this essay describes key pain points for startups and helps new business owners understand how to start well and persevere.
First and foremost, when starting a company, it is often about the “who” more than it is about the “what”. The company may have an excellent product, but the company is without a well-around team that executed the vision. To paraphrase an example, the Harvard Business Review Article Why Startups Fail by Tom Eisenmann (2021) describes two business partners opening a clothing startup and trying to innovate a better way for fitted garments. He states, “Quincy had a good idea but bad bedfellows: Besides the founders, a range of resource providers were culpable in the venture’s collapse, including team members, manufacturing partners, and investors” (para. 18).  It’s clear the business isn’t just built on an innovative product it’s built on the right people. The book Good to Great by Jim Collins (2001) explains this in detail, stating, “The good-to-great leaders began the transformation by first getting the right people on the bus (and the wrong people off the bus) and then figured out where to drive it” ( p. 70)  It’s important to realize that people are more valuable when they have the right traits and motivation to get the company off the ground instead of focusing on acquiring those with knowledge or background, at least to an extent. 
Secondly, a startup may fail because they rush to push their product on the market immediately. Although getting a product onto the market as fast as possible is highly essential for a start-up, it is also important to think about the customer. The customer is often left out of the conversation when a startup is rushing to put a product on the market.  As a result, startups may have a product on the market but soon face setbacks because they realize their product does not match what the market wants. The Harvard Business Review describes this as a false start, stating, “The entrepreneurs are like sprinters who jump the gun: They’re too eager to get a product out there” (Eisenmann, 2021, para. 24). The solution, entrepreneurs and businesses need to do their market research. The Harvard Business Review continues to state, “Entrepreneurs should conduct a competitive analysis, including user testing of existing solutions, to understand the strengths and shortcomings of rival products.” (Eisenmann, 2021, para. 39). Competitive analysis, user testing, and other forms of market research help new startups understand the pain points of customers and how their product or service can be the solution.
Thirdly, startups remain too rigid. Market trends change rapidly, and products and services need to be the same. In the book entitled Lean Start-Up by Erick Ries (2008), he explains progress for the company used to know when to adapt. He states, "Are we making sufficient progress to believe that our original strategic hypothesis is correct, or do we need to make a major change? That change is called a pivot: a structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth." (p. 5) This quote further emphasizes the fact of the idea of constantly adapting to the market needs. A good example is explained in the article Top 6 Reasons New Businesses Fail by M by Michael T. Deane (2024), he states, “One must only look at the music industry or Blockbuster video to know that successful industries can undergo huge changes.” It's clear if companies do not continually adapt, they will be left behind, and a new product or service will simply replace them.
To sum up, successful entrepreneurs avoid driving the bus with the wrong people and find the right people for their teams. They don’t rush their product; they move effectively and don’t forget customer’s needs. They avoid becoming stagnant and quickly adapt to the current trends and conditions of the market.

      <h3>
        Qualities of an Entrepreneur
      </h3>
      <p>
        If there’s one word that can describe entrepreneurs. It’s tough. Business owners can’t simply start a business hoping that everything’s going to go their way and that no challenges will have to be overcome. To be successful in the rough and all-consuming nature of starting a business, you need a couple of qualities to be a tough leader: passion, perseverance, and vision.
When told that people should do what they love for a living, it can breed a bit of false hope, but an entrepreneur’s passion must be bridled like a wild mustang so their passion can focus on a key objective.  In the book Good to Great by Jim Collins (2001), he introduces a concept called the ‘hedgehog concept.’ He explains that hedgehogs are simple animals that are great one thing. Similarly, great companies are good one thing. The concept is designed to help entrepreneurs identify what they can excel with the passion at by answering three main questions: “1. What they can be “best in the world” at? 2. What drives profitability for their business model? 3. What their people are deeply passionate about?”  When all three questions are answered sufficiently, the business owner has a product or business idea that is worth pursuing. Therefore, passion cannot simply be something we love but something we love that drives probability, and we can be the best at it.
Perseverance for an entrepreneur means pushing through difficulty despite wanting to quit. Steve Jobs stated, “I'm convinced that about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance” (Jobs, Luenendonk, as cited in 42 Entrepreneur Quotes to Motivate and Inspire you, 2022, para 4). Often, entrepreneurs feel they have a good enough idea so the idea can carry the company through.  Therefore, when faced with challenges, they crumble, believing that their idea wasn’t good enough. When, in reality, their idea was good enough, their mindset was to push forward until they failed, but the mindset should be bigger than that. Starting a company means starting with an end mission in mind and believing in that mission. So that when you do fail, you can fail again and again and tell you to achieve what you have set out to do. Perseverance is the “how” of getting through the tough challenges of the business and the motivation to get up each day. 
Perseverance is a prerequisite for vision. However, vision differs because it is the “what’ and “why” of a great company.  Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric, stated, "Good business leaders create a vision, articulate the vision, passionately own the vision, and relentlessly drive it to completion" (Welch, Foo, as cited in 39 Inspiring Strategy Quotes From Iconic Business Leaders, 2020, para 4).  Good entrepreneurs don’t just keep going they follow a detailed plan, and the goal is vision. When a company has a good vision, it acts as a guiding star for the business culture. Helping employees stay committed and allowing stakeholders to navigate tough times. Vision can also be described as beginning with the end in mind. Franklin Covey, a popular organization that helps develop leaders, describes vision by stating, “Begin With the End in Mind is about having a plan. If we don’t make a conscious effort to visualize who we are and what we want in life, then we empower other people and circumstances to shape us instead.” If we don’t have a vision, then ultimately, we will be directionless, and even the mundane challenges will shape us, but when we have a vision, we have a clear direction that defines even the mundane actions. Ultimately, perseverance and vision work as a two-sided coin: perseverance sustains effort, while vision ensures that these efforts lead to meaningful outcomes.
In summary, new entrepreneurs must be equipped for anything they make come back running their businesses. Particularly, having attributes of perseverance, passion, and vision will work together to help entrepreneurs develop a successful business.
