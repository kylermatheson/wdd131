        article: 'Early on, entrepreneurs should know what they want to sell. Entrepreneurs ought to sell what they love, but profitability must remain a key factor. To know if a product can be profitable, business owners would benefit from doing market research to understand if their product will be viable in the open market.
The U.S. Small Business Administration (2023) has made a list of what they believe to be six important questions to answer in market research. They state the following: 
“Demand: Is there a desire for your product or service? Market size: How many people would be interested in your offering? Economic indicators: What is the income range and employment rate? Location: Where do your customers live, and where can your business reach? Market saturation: How many similar options are already available to consumers? Pricing: What do potential customers pay for these alternatives?” (para. 4).
The questions show a clear path of needed information to understand if a product can be viable on the open market.  To obtain such an answer, research can be primary or secondary. Primary research is direct research from consumers. This is done through surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Secondary research is business statistics and consumer statistics. Overall, this research is necessary for the success of the business because it avoids pitfalls such as making a product that consumers aren’t interested in or providing a service that is saturated in your area. 
After having a good understanding that the product or service can be viable, it comes time to write the Business Plan. A business plan is a well-written document designed to be the blueprint of how the company will run to sell products or services. It is used to show investors and loan managers that the business is worth investing in and can stay afloat. A business plan is organized into multiple parts. The first part is an executive summary, which showcases the goals and methods that make the business successful, and the plan also includes details such as location, financial growth projections, and a mission statement. Secondly, the plan contains a company description. A company description describes the product or service in detail, the customer, and the unique value proposition of your product or service. Thirdly, in your business plan, you should lay out a market analysis that displays why you're different than the competitor, the pricing of the service or good, and procedures of how the company will deal with challenges. Next, develop a formal mission statement that describes your values, beliefs, and goals as a company. The mission statement should be used internally as a guiding statement for employees in the overall vision of the company. The organizational structure of the company should be laid out in the business plan, such as describing the different roles of the company's employees and, legally, how the company was organized. An operations plan should be described in your business plan, detailing the bills of materials and the standard operating procedure at the company. A marketing plan should be outlined with the four Ps of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion. To fill these four Ps in the marketing plan, the business plan may include a customer profile, the price of product location, a social media plan, an advertising plan, and a swot analysis. Lastly, the business plan should include a financial plan, which contains a breakeven analysis of financial goals and a five-year projection. Overall, a business plan is there for the company and investors to see the basic outline of the business’s present and future plans to deliver a successful product or service.
Other important steps to making your business idea come to fruition are taking necessary legal steps such as registering the business, getting federal and state tax IDs, applying for licenses and permits, opening a business bank account and business insurance, and choosing the legal business structure. This may seem like a lot, but it is mostly nuance and checking boxes. It’s hard to go into detail because of the complexity of each state-by-state law, and it’s best to be looked at by a case-by-case company. However, choosing a business structure is essential and can affect many future decisions. This one can also vary a lot on the type of business you are running, but in most cases, a startup, especially, can default to a limited liability company or L.L.C. An L.L.C. has the best overall option compared to the other business structures because it allows you to protect your personal assets and avoid double taxation. To sum up, the legal actions you must take to start your business are very important but must be dealt with on a case-by-case process. 
To summarize, when starting a business, it’s essential for business owners to understand that their product can be viable and it’s something that they love to do. Then, business owners must understand the plan and the steps they must take to make their product or service come to life: doing market research, creating a detailed business plan for investors and a roadmap for themselves, and taking the legal necessary to bring the business to life. In the end, these steps are almost all clerical steps that hopefully save a headache, but what determines the success of an entrepreneur’s business is their grit and determination.
