        post: `<p class=MsoNormal>Early on, entrepreneurs should know what they want to sell. Entrepreneurs
ought to sell what they love, but profitability must remain a key factor. To
know if a product can be profitable, business owners would benefit from doing
market research to understand if their product will be viable in the open
market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The U.S. Small Business Administration (2023) has made a
list of what they believe to be six important questions to answer in market
research. They state the following: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in'>“Demand:&nbsp;Is
there a desire for your product or service? Market size:&nbsp;How many people
would be interested in your offering? Economic indicators:&nbsp;What is the
income range and employment rate? Location:&nbsp;Where do your customers live,
and where can your business reach? Market saturation:&nbsp;How many similar
options are already available to consumers? Pricing:&nbsp;What do potential
customers pay for these alternatives?” (para. 4).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:0in'>The questions show a clear path of
needed information to understand if a product can be viable on the open
market.  To obtain such an answer, research can be primary or secondary.
Primary research is direct research from consumers. This is done through
surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Secondary research is business
statistics and consumer statistics. Overall, this research is necessary for the
success of the business because it avoids pitfalls such as making a product
that consumers aren’t interested in or providing a service that is saturated in
your area. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After having a good understanding that the product or
service can be viable, it comes time to write the Business Plan. A business
plan is a well-written document designed to be the blueprint of how the company
will run to sell products or services. It is used to show investors and loan
managers that the business is worth investing in and can stay afloat. A
business plan is organized into multiple parts. The first part is an executive
summary, which showcases the goals and methods that make the business
successful, and the plan also includes details such as location, financial
growth projections, and a mission statement. Secondly, the plan contains a
company description. A company description describes the product or service in
detail, the customer, and the unique value proposition of your product or
service. Thirdly, in your business plan, you should lay out a market analysis
that displays why you're different than the competitor, the pricing of the
service or good, and procedures of how the company will deal with challenges. Next,
develop a formal mission statement that describes your values, beliefs, and
goals as a company. The mission statement should be used internally as a
guiding statement for employees in the overall vision of the company. The
organizational structure of the company should be laid out in the business
plan, such as describing the different roles of the company's employees and,
legally, how the company was organized. An operations plan should be described
in your business plan, detailing the bills of materials and the standard operating
procedure at the company. A marketing plan should be outlined with the four Ps
of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion. To fill these four Ps in
the marketing plan, the business plan may include a customer profile, the price
of product location, a social media plan, an advertising plan, and a swot
analysis. Lastly, the business plan should include a financial plan, which contains
a breakeven analysis of financial goals and a five-year projection. Overall, a
business plan is there for the company and investors to see the basic outline
of the business’s present and future plans to deliver a successful product or
service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other important steps to making your business idea come to
fruition are taking necessary legal steps such as registering the business,
getting federal and state tax IDs, applying for licenses and permits, opening a
business bank account and business insurance, and choosing the legal business
structure. This may seem like a lot, but it is mostly nuance and checking
boxes. It’s hard to go into detail because of the complexity of each
state-by-state law, and it’s best to be looked at by a case-by-case company.
However, choosing a business structure is essential and can affect many future
decisions. This one can also vary a lot on the type of business you are
running, but in most cases, a startup, especially, can default to a limited
liability company or L.L.C. An L.L.C. has the best overall option compared to
the other business structures because it allows you to protect your personal
assets and avoid double taxation. To sum up, the legal actions you must take to
start your business are very important but must be dealt with on a case-by-case
process. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To summarize, when starting a business, it’s essential for
business owners to understand that their product can be viable and it’s
something that they love to do. Then, business owners must understand the plan
and the steps they must take to make their product or service come to life:
doing market research, creating a detailed business plan for investors and a
roadmap for themselves, and taking the legal necessary to bring the business to
life. In the end, these steps are almost all clerical steps that hopefully save
a headache, but what determines the success of an entrepreneur’s business is
their grit and determination. </p>`

        post: `
                <p class=MsoNormal>If there’s one word that can describe entrepreneurs. It’s tough. Business owners can’t simply start a business hoping that everything’s going to go their way and that no challenges will have to be overcome. To be successful in the rough and all-consuming nature of starting a business, you need a couple of qualities to be a tough leader: passion, perseverance, and vision.</p>

                <p class=MsoNormal>When told that people should do what they love for a living, it can breed a bit of false hope, but an entrepreneur’s passion must be bridled like a wild mustang so their passion can focus on a key objective.  In the book <i>Good to Great</i> by Jim Collins (2001), he introduces a concept called the ‘hedgehog concept.’ He explains that hedgehogs are simple animals that are great one thing. Similarly, great companies are good one thing. The concept is designed to help entrepreneurs identify what they can excel with the passion at by answering three main questions: “1. What they can be “best in the world” at? 2. What drives profitability for their business model? 3. What their people are deeply passionate about?”  When all three questions are answered sufficiently, the business owner has a product or business idea that is worth pursuing. Therefore,passion cannot simply be something we love but something we love that drives
                    probability, and we can be the best at it.</p>

                    <p class=MsoNormal>Perseverance for an entrepreneur means pushing through
                    difficulty despite wanting to quit. Steve Jobs stated, “I'm convinced that
                    about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful
                    ones is pure perseverance”(Jobs, Luenendonk,
                    as cited in <i>42 Entrepreneur Quotes to Motivate and Inspire you</i>, 2022, para
                    4). Often, entrepreneurs feel they have a good enough idea so the idea can
                    carry the company through.  Therefore, when faced with challenges, they
                    crumble, believing that their idea wasn’t good enough. When, in reality, their
                    idea was good enough, their mindset was to push forward until they failed, but
                    the mindset should be bigger than that. Starting a company means starting with
                    an end mission in mind and believing in that mission. So that when you do fail,
                    you can fail again and again and tell you to achieve what you have set out to do.
                    Perseverance is the “how” of getting through the tough challenges of the
                    business and the motivation to get up each day. </p>

                    <p class=MsoNormal>Perseverance is a prerequisite for vision. However, vision
                    differs because it is the “what’ and “why” of a great company.  Jack Welch,
                    former CEO of General Electric, stated, &quot;Good business leaders create a
                    vision, articulate the vision, passionately own the vision, and relentlessly
                    drive it to completion&quot; (Welch, Foo, as cited in <i>39 Inspiring Strategy Quotes
                    From Iconic Business Leaders</i>, 2020, para 4).  Good entrepreneurs don’t just
                    keep going they follow a detailed plan, and the goal is vision. When a company
                    has a good vision, it acts as a guiding star for the business culture. Helping
                    employees stay committed and allowing stakeholders to navigate tough times.
                    Vision can also be described as beginning with the end in mind. Franklin Covey,
                    a popular organization that helps develop leaders, describes vision by stating,
                    “Begin With the End in Mind is about having a plan. If we don’t make a
                    conscious effort to visualize who we are and what we want in life, then we
                    empower other people and circumstances to shape us instead.” If we don’t have a
                    vision, then ultimately, we will be directionless, and even the mundane
                    challenges will shape us, but when we have a vision, we have a clear direction
                    that defines even the mundane actions. Ultimately, perseverance and vision work
                    as a two-sided coin: perseverance sustains effort, while vision ensures that
                    these efforts lead to meaningful outcomes.</p>

                    <p class=MsoNormal>In summary, new entrepreneurs must be equipped for anything
                    they make come back running their businesses. Particularly, having attributes
                    of perseverance, passion, and vision will work together to help entrepreneurs
                    develop a successful business.</p>`

            'Starting a business can be daunting, but understanding key factors like the importance of a strong team, market research, and adaptability can increase a startup\'s chance of success. This article explores common pitfalls and how to avoid them, with insights from experts like Tom Eisenmann, Jim Collins, and Eric Ries.',

        post: `<p class=MsoNormal>When it comes to starting a business, there is a lot that
goes into it; a lot can go wrong.  The article <i>Why Start-ups</i> by Tom
Eisenmann (2021) “Most start-ups don’t succeed: More than two-thirds of them
never deliver a positive return to investors” (para. 1). Statistics make
starting a business seem to be daunting, but fear stems from not knowing.  The
following information in this essay describes key pain points for startups and
helps new business owners understand how to start well and persevere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First and foremost, when starting a company, it is often
about the <span style='color:black'>“</span>who” more than it is about the
“what”. The company may have an excellent product, but the company is without a
well-around team that executed the vision. To paraphrase an example, the
Harvard Business Review Article <i>Why Startups Fail</i> by Tom Eisenmann
(2021) describes two business partners opening a clothing startup and trying to
innovate a better way for fitted garments. He states, “Quincy had a good idea
but bad bedfellows: Besides the founders, a range of resource providers were
culpable in the venture’s collapse, including team members, manufacturing
partners, and investors” (para. 18).  It’s clear the business isn’t just built
on an innovative product it’s built on the right people. The book <i>Good to
Great </i>by Jim Collins (2001) explains this in detail, stating, “The
good-to-great leaders began the transformation by first getting the right
people on the bus (and the wrong people off the bus) and then figured out where
to drive it” ( p. 70)  It’s important to realize that people are more valuable
when they have the right traits and motivation to get the company off the
ground instead of focusing on acquiring those with knowledge or background, at
least to an extent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Secondly, a startup may fail because they rush to push their
product on the market immediately. Although getting a product onto the market
as fast as possible is highly essential for a start-up, it is also important to
think about the customer. The customer is often left out of the conversation
when a startup is rushing to put a product on the market.  As a result,
startups may have a product on the market but soon face setbacks because they
realize their product does not match what the market wants. The Harvard
Business Review describes this as a false start, stating, “The entrepreneurs
are like sprinters who jump the gun: They’re too eager to get a product out
there” (Eisenmann, 2021, para. 24). The solution, entrepreneurs and businesses
need to do their market research. The Harvard Business Review continues to
state, “Entrepreneurs should conduct a competitive analysis, including user
testing of existing solutions, to understand the strengths and shortcomings of
rival products.” (Eisenmann, 2021, para. 39). Competitive analysis, user
testing, and other forms of market research help new startups understand the
pain points of customers and how their product or service can be the solution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thirdly, startups remain too rigid. Market trends change
rapidly, and products and services need to be the same. In the book entitled <i>Lean
Start-Up</i> by Erick Ries (2008), he explains progress for the company used to
know when to adapt. He states, &quot;Are we making sufficient progress to
believe that our original strategic hypothesis is correct, or do we need to
make a major change? That change is called a pivot: a structured course
correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product,
strategy, and engine of growth.&quot; (p. 5) This quote further emphasizes the
fact of the idea of constantly adapting to the market needs. A good example is
explained in the article <i>Top 6 Reasons New Businesses Fail </i>by M by Michael
T. Deane (2024), he states, “One must only look at the music industry or
Blockbuster video to know that successful industries can undergo huge changes.”
It's clear if companies do not continually adapt, they will be left behind, and
a new product or service will simply replace them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To sum up, successful entrepreneurs avoid driving the bus
with the wrong people and find the right people for their teams. They don’t
rush their product; they move effectively and don’t forget customer’s needs.
They avoid becoming stagnant and quickly adapt to the current trends and
conditions of the market.</p>`
